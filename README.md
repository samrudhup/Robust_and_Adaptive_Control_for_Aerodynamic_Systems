# Robust_and_Adaptive_Control_for_Aerodynamic_Systems

Aero3_2p4.m 

Considering the longitudinal aircraft dynamics from Aero1.m representing the aircraft incremental dynamics with respect to the trim conditions, this code shows the design of an infinite-time LQR to regualte the state vector to zero.
